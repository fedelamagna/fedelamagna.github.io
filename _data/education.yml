  summary: '<i>Life and the world, as the vision of every man: We live upon stones and clay, among wood with green leaves, devouring fragments of the universe which includes us, among open fires, among fluids, combining sounds, protecting what's past and what's to come, painful, warm-blooded, ritualistic, dreaming that we dream, irritated, smelling, touching, among people, in an insatiable garden which our fall will abolish</i>.
<br><i> Vision of physics: An opaque, endless extension of protons and electrons, radiating in the void; or perhaps (ghost of a universe) the totality of radiations of a substance that does not exist.</i>
  <br><br> Research applied Quantum Field Theory tools to the study of wave propagation in Random Media. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03845">Learn more here</a>. You can also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03845">read the whole thesis</a> if you are interested.'

  
- degree: Academic Stay during PhD
  uni: ICAS - Universidad de San Mart&iacute;n (UNSAM)
  year: 2019 &mdash; 2020
  award: Research Fields&#58; Applied Machine Learning, High Energy Physics
  summary: As part of my PhD, I did an academic stay in the International Center for Advanced Studies, in the Universidad de San Mart&iacute;n campus. Our research subjects involved the consideration of Machine Learning tools and their applications in High Energy Phenomenology problems. Particularly, we focused on the distinction between signal and backgrounds in processes involving the Top quark, which could potentially hide new physics. Besides working in particle physics, some of these advances in Machine Learning were considered for certain real-life scenarios.

  summary: My research focused on Beyond the Standard Model physics, particularly with approaches to the Higgs Hierarchy Problem and the recent B-meson anomalies in flavor physics. We considered different approaches to these problems by making use of the Composite Higgs framework. With an effective theory description, we modelled the particle content of the new physics sector, and considered in detail their effect on well defined flavor observables, along with the B-anomalies.
